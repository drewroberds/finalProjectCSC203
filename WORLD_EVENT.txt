intial ideas
- click drops a yeti mountain, yeti spawns, grabs dudes, and pulls them into his mountain.
- after a certain amount of time, the dudes escape


idea 2.0
- yeti mountain discolors the ground around it
- when dudes escape, they are "afflicted"
- afflicted dudes must eat a fairy or die in x world cycles
	-if they eat a fairy, they revert to a dude_NF

- additional options
	- button press to spawn dudes/fairies maybe trees or houses?
	- there are guy and girl dudes who bang when they are adjacent and have baby
		- % chance
	- dudes would come out of mountain naked but with a censor bar over hips
		- yeti steals dudes clothes and starts doing dude activityy
		- dude respawns after a period of time and tries to beat up yeti_dude
		- yeti_dude goes comatose
		- fairy's revive yeti dude as ronnie coleman posing
